                <div class="title">FAVICON SNAKE</div>
                <div class="subtitle">Inspired by favicon game projects like the Defender of the Favicon by <a href="http://www.p01.org/about/">Mathieu 'p01' Henri</a> 
                    and Favicon Dino Game by <a href="https://github.com/Mashpoe/favicon-dino-game">Mashpoe</a>, Favicon Snake Game is a similar project that makes popular
                    game genre "snake" playable in the favicon.

                    <div class="heading">About this project üí°</div>
                    <div class="paragraph">
                        The project was started in May of 2022 for a school assignment at the Faculty of Mathematics, Natural Sciences and Information Technologies.
                        The assignment was simple i.e. create a snake game and no other details were specified, so I took the oppurtunity to take my mind off school
                        and do some creative coding. 
                        <div class="br"></div>
                        I have been programming in JavaScript and doing web-dev for three years prior to taking this course at my university, so I wanted to do something
                        more interesting. The result is a snake game, like the assignment specified, but it runs in the browser tab icon called a "favicon".
                        <div class="br"></div>
                        A big inspiration for the game was a project I found while looking for a method to animate a favicon for my portfolio website called Defender of the Favicon by <a href="http://www.p01.org/about/">Mathieu 'p01' Henri</a>.
                        It lead me down a rabbit hole and I found another favicon game called Favicon Dino Game by a youtuber <a href="https://github.com/Mashpoe/favicon-dino-game">Mashpoe</a>.
                        <div class="br"></div>
                        The game runs in the HTML canvas, that gets converted to arrays of data: URIs and displayed as the site's favicon. The sprites were drawin in 
                        Adobe Photoshop in 16 x 16 pixel resolution and converted to URIs by a Node.js library <a href="https://github.com/DiegoZoracKy/image-data-uri">img-data-uri.js</a> 
                        by Diego ZoracKy.
                        <div class="br"></div>
                        Game's logic makes use of asynchronous JavaScript to run a seamless game loop from start screen to game over screen and repeats for endless gameplay.
                        Big part of the snake code was done by an awesome game developer and youtuber <a href="https://pastebin.com/Z3zhb7cY">Chris DeLeon</a>.
                        I wanted to improve on the code but I don't like reinventing the wheel so besides adding new functionality, big part of the code remains 
                        the same as Chris'.

                    <div class="paragraph">
                        Assuming you don't already know snake, snake is a game genre that is comprised of a lot of different looking games.
                        All snake games generally have similar gameplay, but some try to build on the idea and add new functionality.
                        The player is a dot, a square or something similar and moves on the playing field while leaving behind a trail. 
                        The shape resembles a snake hence the name of the game. Player's main objective is to collect or "eat" items, often red dots resembling apples,
                        that increase the snake's length making it progressively more dificult to maneuver the snake. Player looses or "dies" if the head of the snake touches it's
                        tail or the border of the screen.
                        <div class="br"></div>
                        Some games differ and add a looping game field that makes the snake able to move from the edge of the screen to the adjacent side. My implementation of snake is the looping type.
                        There is a second gameplay variant, similar to the one previously mentioned, in which the player plays against an AI or other players and attempts to block others and make them run
                        into the body of an existing snake and loose.
                        <div class="br"></div>
                        The snake I remember playing was on old Nokia phones from the 2000s onward, but the first snake game dates back to the arcade game Blockade, developed and published by Gremlin in 1976.

                        This was an incredibly fun project to work on so a thank you goes to UP FAMNIT for making me code something I never would have otherwise.
                        Maybe someday I will improve on this idea and make a bigger favicon game or something else to do with favicons entirely. But until that day we will have to do with
                        existing favicon games.
